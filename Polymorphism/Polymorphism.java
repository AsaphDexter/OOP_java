 * 
 * Polymorphism in java is a concept by which we can perform a single action by different ways. 
 * Polymorphism is derived from 2 greek words: poly and morphs. The word "poly" means many and "morphs" means forms. 
 * So polymorphism means many forms.
There are two types of polymorphism in java: compile time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism. 
* We can perform polymorphism in java by method overloading and method overriding.

If you overload static method in java, it is the example of compile time polymorphism. 
* Here, we will focus on runtime polymorphism in java.

//Upcasting
//When reference variable of Parent class refers to the object of Child class, 
//it is known as upcasting. For example:

/*class A{}  
class B extends A{}  
A a=new B();//upcasting  */
