# OOP_java
Using an object-oriented approach, we structure our programme as a collection of various objects that includes both data and behaviour. By laying down basic guidelines, object-oriented programming (OOPs) is a paradigm that makes it easier to design and maintain software.

Basic concepts of OOPs are:
1. Object
2. Class
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism
5. Abstraction
6. Encapsulation
